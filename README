Investigation of building an Electronic Mode Filter (EMF) using a microstrip design. First step is to approximate the
mode function (more precisely the time reversed mode function) with a rational H(s). A rational H(s) represents a
lumped RLC filter.

% impulse(triang_resp(0.5,12),2.5)

% optimize_ct_impulse
% or provide a custom target via function handle and capture the TF:
% sys = optimize_ct_impulse(@soft_exp_decay)
